# VSC GSQL Extension

This extensions provides syntax highlighting capabilities for TigerGraph's GSQL. This is mostly hacked together from:
* [alejandropoveda/atom-language-gsql](https://github.com/alejandropoveda/atom-language-gsql)
* [jmeekhof/gsql-vim](https://github.com/jmeekhof/gsql-vim)
* [fjblau/gsql-sublime](https://github.com/fjblau/gsql-sublime)

NOTE! This is still in development and has quite a bit of work and testing to do
